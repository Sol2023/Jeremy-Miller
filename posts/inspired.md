# Inspired: How to Create Tech Products Customers Love

Having recently transitioned from 'Data Scientist' to 'Product Manager, Data Science', I thought it a good idea to read some of the canonical texts in the field of Product Management. After talking to some experienced PMs and digging around, Marty Cagan's books rose to the top of the priority queue. _Inspired_ was the natural place to start. 

### What I Learned
Firstly, the book is very good and reads quickly. Really anyone in tech should read it. Engineers and executives will likely gain some valuable perspective and useful mental models. A dedicated reader could get through it in a weekend. Anyone with free time should be able to finish in a week or two. 

_Inspired_ did a great job of answering my primary question: What is the role of the Product Manager? Simple: the primary responsibility of the PM is ensuring that the engineers have a product worth building (43, 91). Of course, it's not so simple. A PM has to be an expert in the business, market, industry, customers, and users (44, 47). PMs also must manage the middle ground between business stakeholders and engineers, helping everyone understand that we are all on the same team (48, 59). What's more, a PM needs solid understanding of both computer programming and business finance (51). These tools allow the PM to code switch between the two worlds and ensure that the right work gets done. 

Cagan spends many pages talking about what NOT to do. In fact the book starts by saying "here's what most companies do; don't do this". Cagan then describes a Waterfall-like process which with many of us are familiar. The problem Cagan argues is that customer validation happens way too late. All of the risk is at the end of the process (16-20).

You may be thinking "But I know what my users want now! So I can just build it out." Not so, says Cagan, by referring repeatedly to the "two uncomfortable truths about product" (19, 111):
* At least half of your ideas simply won't work
* For those that do, it will take several iterations to get it right  

Hence Waterfall-style roadmaps with long lead times carry way too much risk. Instead, we should quickly build something small, validate it with users before proceeding, iterate quickly, and repeat the validation often. That sounds agile (lower case 'a'). Most of my interactions with Agile (upper case 'A') in a professional setting have been in the context of someone asking me to adopt a lot of extra process without being able to articulate what problems that process solves, other than "this is the way we do it". I believe "Agile" can be done in an agile fashion. After all it was created to solve real problems with software development. I'm drawn to this quote from Justin Etheredge [here](https://www.simplethread.com/20-things-ive-learned-in-my-20-years-as-a-software-engineer/): 
> Keep your processes as lean as possible
Everyone wants to be agile these days, but being “agile” is about building things in small chunks, learning, and then iterating. If someone is trying to shoehorn much more into it than that, then they’re probably selling something. It isn’t to say that people don’t need accountability or help to work this way, but how many times have you heard someone from your favorite tech company or large open source project brag about how great their Scrum process is? Stay lean on process until you know you need more. Trust your team and they will deliver.

### Criticisms
I hesitate to offer too many criticisms given the quality and stature of Cagan's text, and my relative lack of experience as a PM. However, I feel comfortable saying that due to Cagan's choice of structure there is a wandering experience in reading the text. More than once I felt like I was time travelling (page travelling?). A fair amount of repetition is warranted to make the key points. Nonetheless it's not difficult to imagine other structures that would have facilitated the arguments without the wandering experience. _The Phoenix Project_ and _The Unicorn Project_ come to mind.

That said, if you are Product Manager or you work with one, you should read _Inspired_. I find it difficult to imagine that anyone in one of these circumstances would not enjoy the book and learn a few things. For PMs, the second half of the book describes a set of techniques to do product "the right way". Surely there are tools here we can learn to use and benefit from.
